👋 Hi, I’m Kesmond Wilson – Cybersecurity Professional
With over 3 years of experience in the cybersecurity field, I’m passionate about protecting systems, networks, and data from evolving threats. 
Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work across multiple domains of cybersecurity, strengthening my skills and deepening my expertise.

🛠️ Areas of Expertise

I specialize in several key areas of cybersecurity, including:
- Security Compliance and Risk Management – Ensuring organizations meet security and regulatory standards by managing risks and aligning with frameworks like NIST, ISO 27001, and GDPR.
- Vulnerability Management – Proactively identifying, assessing, and remediating vulnerabilities across infrastructure to reduce the attack surface.
-Incident Response (IR) – Leading and supporting incident investigations, containment strategies, and root cause analysis to effectively mitigate and respond to security breaches.
- Firewall Management and Network Defense – Designing, configuring, and managing firewall policies, as well as defending network infrastructures against unauthorized access and attacks.
- Cloud Security – Securing cloud environments, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, to ensure compliance and data protection across multi-cloud platforms.
- Security Automation and Orchestration (SOAR) – Implementing and managing SOAR solutions to automate repetitive tasks, reduce response times, and enhance operational efficiency.

🌱 Continuous Learning & Growth

Cybersecurity is a constantly evolving field, and I believe in staying ahead of the curve. I am continually working on:
- Expanding my knowledge of advanced threat hunting and traffic analysis techniques.
- Gaining hands-on experience with next-gen security technologies, such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and endpoint detection and response (EDR).
- Exploring emerging fields like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in threat detection and prevention.

📈 Career Highlights

- Successfully led the response to several high-severity incidents, significantly reducing downtime and damage.
- Played a pivotal role in the design and implementation of vulnerability management programs, reducing critical risks for several enterprise clients.
- Conducted thorough penetration testing and risk assessments, resulting in measurable improvements in network and system security posture.

🤝 Let’s Connect

I’m always looking to expand my professional network and collaborate with others in the cybersecurity space. Whether you’re interested in discussing new trends, sharing insights, or working on exciting projects together, feel free to reach out!
