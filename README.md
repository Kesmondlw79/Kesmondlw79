👋 Hi, I'm Kes — Program Manager & Cybersecurity Analyst with IAM Expertise  

Welcome to my GitHub! With a diverse background in Program Management, Cybersecurity, and Identity & Access Management (IAM), I’ve had the privilege of working across several industries, including manufacturing, insurance, and federal government. My expertise spans managing complex projects, leading security initiatives, and safeguarding critical systems in dynamic environments. Along the way, I’ve honed essential skills in team leadership, mentoring, problem-solving, and communication, which have been key to my success in both managing teams and addressing security challenges.  

 🎯 Objective  
I’m currently seeking a position as a Analyst, where I can apply my cybersecurity skills, IAM expertise, and analytical mindset to monitor, detect, and respond to security incidents. My goal is to grow within a dynamic team, leveraging my knowledge of security protocols, identity governance, privileged access management (PAM), network analysis, and incident response to protect critical infrastructure and contribute to organizational success.  

🧑‍💼 Program Manager & IAM Specialist  
As a Program Manager and IAM Specialist, I’ve successfully led and managed programs across different sectors, implementing structured methodologies to ensure security, compliance, and efficiency. I specialize in IAM strategies, ensuring that access to critical systems is secure, compliant, and aligned with business needs.  

Key Skills & Focus Areas:  
- Identity Governance & Administration (IGA): Implementing SailPoint, Okta, and Azure AD for centralized access control, reducing unauthorized access risks.  
- Privileged Access Management (PAM): Configuring and managing CyberArk to secure privileged accounts and mitigate insider threats.  
- Zero Trust Security Model: Implementing Zero Trust architectures with multi-factor authentication (MFA) and least privilege access controls.  
- IAM Compliance & Audits: Ensuring NIST, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and SOX compliance by conducting IAM risk assessments and implementing access review processes.  
- Project Documentation & Roadmaps: Creating IAM roadmaps, access management policies, and security workflows for streamlined operations.  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Designing and enforcing RBAC policies to ensure segregation of duties (SoD) and minimize attack surfaces.  
- Mentoring & Team Leadership: Coaching IT teams on IAM best practices, fostering a security-first culture, and **building high-performance teams.  

🛡️ Cybersecurity Analyst (Blue Team) & IAM Defender  
In my role as a Cybersecurity Analyst and IAM Specialist, I specialize in defending systems, managing identities, and enforcing access controls to prevent cyber threats and ensure compliance.  

Key Skills & Focus Areas: 
- Security Operations Center (SOC): Monitoring and managing security incidents using Splunk, QRadar, and ELK Stack. 
- IAM Incident Response: Investigating account takeovers, access anomalies, and privilege escalations using SIEM and SOAR tools.  
- Traffic Analysis & Threat Hunting: Using Wireshark and Zeek** to detect anomalous access patterns and unauthorized privilege escalations.  
- Cloud Security & IAM: Implementing identity security measures in AWS (IAM Policies, S3 Bucket Controls) and Azure (Conditional Access, Defender for Identity).  
- Vulnerability Management: Identifying IAM misconfigurations using Tenable, Qualys, and Nessus, ensuring remediation of security gaps.  
- Firewall & SOAR: Enforcing IAM-based firewall policies and automating response workflows with alo Alto Cortex XSOAR.  

💬 Additional Skills
I believe that success in cybersecurity and IAM is not just about technical expertise but also about strategic thinking, leadership, and collaboration. 

- Customer Service:Ensuring seamless user access while enforcing security best practices.  
- Problem-Solving:Resolving complex IAM challenges, from privilege creep to access recertification.  
- Communication: Translating technical security policies into clear, actionable IAM strategies for stakeholders.  

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
